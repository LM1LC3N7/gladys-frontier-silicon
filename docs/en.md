# Frontier Silicon radios

**Unofficial connector, not affiliated with Frontier Smart Technologies nor with
the radio brands.** It brings into Gladys the internet radios built on a
Frontier Silicon module: Roberts, Hama, Medion, Revo, Lenco, Auna and many
others, usually the ones the **UNDOK** app controls. Everything stays on
your local network: no account, no cloud.

**Testers wanted**: this first version was written without a radio at hand,
from the protocol as the Home Assistant integration uses it. Tell us on the
forum what works on your model, and what does not.

## Setup

1. Install the integration and open **Discovery**: the radios answering on
   your network are listed (Gladys asks them through SSDP). Add yours.
2. A radio is missing? Its address goes in **Radio addresses** (an IP or a
   host name, several separated by commas), then scan again. Give your radios
   a fixed address in your router: a radio that changed address is found
   again by a new scan in Discovery.
3. The **PIN**: the radios ship with 1234; leave the field empty in that
   case. If you changed it (menu Settings > Network > NetRemote PIN setup),
   type it here.
4. Put the **Internet radio** widget on a dashboard and pick a radio.

Each radio is read every 30 seconds (option **Refresh interval**), every 5
seconds for a minute after a command. Some models leave the network in
standby: they show as **offline** (and off) and are tried again once a
minute, quietly.

## Scenes

- **Now playing changed**: pick a radio (or none for all), and optionally
  what changed (**station or source**, or **title on the same station**) and
  the source. Variables: the radio name, the station or title (`name`), the
  text (the song on internet radio, the scrolling text on DAB), the artist,
  the album, the source and a one-line summary. Changes made through Gladys
  (a preset played by a scene, a source chosen from the dashboard) do not
  fire it: a scene can never loop through the radio. On DAB the scrolling
  text changes often: filter on "station" if you only want the station.
- **Play a preset**: the radio, the preset (`3` as on the radio, or a name
  such as `France Inter`), and optionally the source to switch to first
  (`DAB`, `FM`, `internet radio`…: each source has its own presets). The
  radio is turned on if needed. The **List the presets** button shows what
  a radio has stored.
- **Change the source**: the radio and the source, by the name the radio
  shows or `DAB`, `FM`, `internet radio`, `Spotify`, `Bluetooth`, `AUX`.
- **Now playing** gives `power`, `playing`, `name`, `text`, `artist`,
  `summary`, `volume`… for a message or a condition. The following actions
  of the scene find them in their variable list (written
  `{{<step>.<action>.<key>}}`, for instance `{{0.0.summary}}` when this
  action is the first of the scene).

The generic **Control a device** scene action also drives the power, the
volume, the source and the transport buttons. **Mute** is shown by Gladys as
a button: each press switches the mute on or off.

## Good to know

- No session is opened on the radio: the UNDOK app keeps working next to
  Gladys (a session would kick it out, the radios allow only one).
- The presets are read only when needed (the widget, a scene, the button),
  never in the background: reading them puts the radio in "navigation" mode,
  as the UNDOK app does.
- The radios answer one request at a time: Gladys never sends two at once,
  and waits a moment after each change.

## Troubleshooting

- **No radio in Discovery**: the scan needs a network that lets multicast
  through (no VLAN between Gladys and the radio); type the address of the
  radio in the configuration instead. Check that the radio answers: **Test the radios**.
- **"refused the PIN"**: set the radio's PIN in the configuration.
- **Offline**: the radio is unplugged, in deep standby (some models turn
  their Wi-Fi off; look for a "network standby" or "keep network connected"
  option in their menu), or it changed address: scan again in Discovery.
- Logs: the integration's log level is set with the `LOG_LEVEL` variable.
  The PIN never appears in them.

## Privacy

The integration only talks to your radios, on your local network. Nothing
leaves your home.
